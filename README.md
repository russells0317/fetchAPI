## Description of Project
This is a project example to use Axios or fetch() to pull data from an external source and display it on a React App. For this project, I really struggled and had to use a step-by-step guide on how to write the code for this. In the end, this external source finds products and features them for purchase. How to Run: In order to run this file, download all the files to a singular location. Open a browser window and drag the index.html file to the window and begin interacting with the code. Roadmap: I plan to revisit this project to work with other external sources that can be utilized: memes, sports updates, etc. I was unable to do this organically and will need to change the code significantly to implement those.
